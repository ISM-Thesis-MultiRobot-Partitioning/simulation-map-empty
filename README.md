# About

Similar to [`simulation-map-expand`](https://github.com/ISM-Thesis-MultiRobot-Partitioning/simulation-map-expand), with the aim of creating an empty map, instead of expanding an existing one.

`OUTPUT_CHANNEL` is an environment variable allows specifying the topic on which the map will be published.
